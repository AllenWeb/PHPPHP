A partial PHP implementation in PHP

This is a basic VM implemented in PHP using the [AST generating parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) developed by @nikic

To see what's supported so far, check out the opcodes.

To use, edit the code in the parser in test.php...

Right now, functions (definitions and calls) are supported, as are variables and some basic variable operations...

For The Love Of God, Why?

I ask, *Why Not?*
